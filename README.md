This project aims to classify stroke and non-stroke cases based on facial paralysis using deep learning. We employ the YOLOv9 model for image detection and analysis, capitalizing on its accuracy in real-time object detection. Federated learning ensures data privacy by training models across multiple decentralized devices without centralizing data. NVIDIA Clara, along with the SDK Manager, facilitates the development and deployment of our models. This approach not only enhances detection efficiency but also preserves patient confidentiality, fostering advancements in medical diagnostics and personalized healthcare solutions through innovative AI technologies.
